This folder contains the pseudo code for the starvation free solution to the classical Readers-Writers problem. This is basically a pseudo code written with the help of text formatting used in C++. Hence neither any Headers Files are included in any of the files nor any file can be compiled and exectuted. Pseudo code presented in the folder just displays how the actual implementation should look like.
